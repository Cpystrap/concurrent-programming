# Concurrent Programming

This repository contains exercises and projects for concurrent programming in Java and C.  
It demonstrates different concurrency models such as **threads**, **processes**, and **asynchronous programming**.

## Structure
- `lab_exercises/` – simple code samples demonstrating various concurrency mechanisms from my concurrent programming classes.
- `projects/` – bigger tasks.

## WARNING:
Every file with a additional _skeleton in name is a file writen by Lecturer of Concurrent Programming at the University of Warsaw. Also in big projects in README you can find which files were additionally given to the task and not written by myself.
