# Concurrent Programming Examples

This repository contains exercises and projects for concurrent programming in Java and C.  
It demonstrates different concurrency models such as **threads**, **processes**, and **asynchronous programming**.

## Structure
- `lab_exercises/` – simple code samples demonstrating various concurrency mechanisms from my concurrent programming classes.
- `projects/` – bigger tasks.
